# Narrow DNS adapter

This is the entire effectful name-resolution boundary. Input validation and
error wrapping happen in Lean, and the pinned standard library owns the libuv
`getaddrinfo` adapter. The result is deliberately reduced to numeric address
strings so policy and deduplication remain in Lean.

/-- Perform exactly one standard-library `getaddrinfo` operation without
parking a worker. The optional token is cooperative: libuv exposes no DNS
cancel primitive, so cancellation waits for the exact native request to settle,
discards its observation, and then returns an error. No resolver continuation
is detached.

The port is supplied as the numeric service so the platform applies the same
socket-address filtering as the eventual connector. `IO.Error` is retained
unchanged in `Error.resolver`. -/
