/-!
Socket-driving wrappers over the sans-I/O TLS engines. A `ClientSession` /
`ServerSession` owns a `TCP.Socket.Client` plus the TLS state behind a mutex, and
exposes `send` (application data) and `feedInbound` (raw transport bytes ->
decrypted application data).

TLS records must reach the wire in sequence-number order. Sealing (which advances
the write sequence) happens under the session lock; the resulting record bytes are
enqueued to a single per-session writer task that performs the actual socket write
with no lock held. Because seal-and-enqueue is atomic under the lock and the writer
is a single FIFO consumer, wire order equals sequence order — without ever holding
the lock across a blocking socket write (which would deadlock decrypt against
encrypt on a busy connection).

/-- Drive a client handshake to completion over `socket`. Sends ClientHello, then

Runs in `Async` so its socket waits suspend cooperatively — a blocking handshake
would park a worker, and in a same-process client+server (a loopback test) the few
pool workers can all be parked at once, deadlocking the peer's handshake.

Returns the established state together with any application plaintext that was
coalesced behind the peer's final handshake flight in the same transport chunk
(TLS 1.3 permits the server to seal application data — e.g. an eager HTTP/2
SETTINGS — directly after its Finished).  Dropping those bytes desynchronizes the
